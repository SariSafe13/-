# -Assignment 1 
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Assignment Goal is to Develop a an Algorithm Offline for Elevator.

It consists of 4 classes and we implement this classes and The Algorithm .

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*To implement this class We used the collection data structure :arraylist 
Actually we used 2 arraylists: One is resposible for the Calls that are going UP.
The seconed one represents the Calls that are going DOWN.

***In this Assignmet we learned to program in the python we knew the language to the level of implementation***
 properties :
  
  #--List
  #--csv
  #--jason  
  #--Panda Package
  #--dictonary
  
  constructor:
    for every class we created by depend on the details in csv Files and Jason
    
  methods:
    Algo()- It allocats the call to the closest elevator to its source.(our algorithm
   
    
   Secondary Methods :
    there no use with secondary methods
